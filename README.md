# Space Engineer

## Description

**This is a (WIP) port of [Space Engineer](https://github.com/FAnargyrou/SpaceEngineer-Unity) from Unity to MonoGame**

Our submission to Coding Blocks Game Jam 2021. 

You play as a solitaire engineer in his hunk-a-junk space ship.
Keep it nice and tidy and fix everything that's broken!

Use toolbox to find the right tool for the job at hand.

WASD / Arrows = Controls the Engineer.
Left Mouse Button / LCTRL = Interact.
ESC / Right Mouse Button = Opens the Menu.

Try to survive in this broken mess of a ship!
